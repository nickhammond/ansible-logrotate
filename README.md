  vars:
    logrotate_scripts:

        path: /var/log/nginx/options.log
        options:

        scripts:
          postrotate: "echo test"

  roles:
    - ansible-logrotate
```

## Testing locally

This role is already configured to run on travis CI within a test playbook but it's useful to be able to run and debug a role locally which can be done via molecule and docker provisioner.

To run the test locally, [install molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), then run

```
molecule test
```
