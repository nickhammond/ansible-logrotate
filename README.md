        options:
          - daily

        scripts:
          postrotate: "echo test"

  roles:
    - ansible-logrotate
```

## Testing locally

This role is already configured to run on travis CI within a test playbook but it's useful to be able to run and debug a role locally which can be done via Vagrant and the `ansible_local` provisioner.

To run the test playbook locally within a Vagrant virtual machine:

```
cd tests
vagrant up --provision
```
